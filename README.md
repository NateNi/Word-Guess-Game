# Word-Guess-Game

## What the project does:
This project replicates the word guessing game "hangman" with a video game theme.  Users are given six incorrect guesses per word to type all of the letters within the hidden mystery word.  The guessed letters, number of wins, number of incorrect guesses ("lives"), and mystery word with revealed letters are all displayed on the page and are updated as the game is played.

## Why the project is useful:
The game hangman is fully functional and can be played for multiple rounds.  This version of the game might be chosen over traditional pen and paper hangman because it only requires one player and a computer (as pen and paper may not be available to the user).

## How users can get started with the project:
After loading the page, onscreen prompts will guide the user through the game and tell them everything they need to know.

## Where users can get help:
The traditional rules of hangman are readily available online.  Additionally you are welcome to contact me at the email address nniesel90@gmail.com

## Who maintains and contributes to the project:
As of the most current version, all work has been done by Nathan Niesel.
